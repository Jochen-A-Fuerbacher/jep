== Abstract

This JEP documents a process and implementation for a public Jenkins roadmap
which would be published on the Jenkins website and considered as an official plan by the project.
See the motivation below.

== Specification

=== Summary

* Jenkins project provides a public roadmap.
  It includes open data and a good browsing interface for users.
* The roadmap aggregates key initiatives in all areas: features, infrastructure, documentation, community, etc.
  Initiatives are categorized to reflect the structure of the project.
* We do not provide any target dates.
  Instead of that we provide 3 horizons: “Current”, “Near Term” and “Future”
* We do NOT commit on initiative delivery.
  Jenkins is a community-driven project, and the change will happen in areas where we have contributions. Initiatives in the roadmap may stop.
* Roadmap is contributed by key component maintainers (e.g. Jenkins Core, Remoting, packaging, etc.),
  special interest groups (Platform, UX, Docs, GSoC, ...),
  teams (Security, Infrastructure, Hosting, Release, ...), sub-projects (JCasC, ...),
  plugin maintainer teams and other entities.

=== Terms and definitions

Horizons:

* _Current_ - things being worked on presently with a specific scope, typically a JEP, though no specific delivery dates
* _Near Term_ - a wider area of focus with more flexibility of
scope and design options (no specific timeframe but will be reconsidered
in the future)#
* _Future_ - higher level things to be considered with a broad scope
 (timescales varied - later items will be reprioritized once _Current_ and _Near Term_ items progress significantly)
* _Completed_ - Initiative which is largely completed and, in the case of user-facing changes, released/deployed.
It is also properly documented and announced.
There might be some minor follow-ups remaining.


=== Technical implementation

* Roadmap data files are stored in a GitHub repository.
Location is to be defined.

** Option 1: Storing the data file inside https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io[https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io]
** Option 2: New https://github.com/jenkinsci/roadmap[https://github.com/jenkinsci/roadmap] repository
Current prototype implementation allows downloading it from a remote location like CDN on the client side.
For example, link:https://www.jsdelivr.com/[jsDelivr] allows using CDN for GitHub files, we use it on the plugin site.

* Roadmap data files use a machine readable JSON or YAML format.
  They include an array of entries.
  Each of them represents a major initiative in the project.
* Each entry includes the following information:
** _Summary_ - short summary displayed on the Roadmap dashboard
** _Description_ - detailed description which may be visualized in a popup window
** _Category_ (or categories) - classifier of the initiative. Examples
*** Features: Configuration-as-Code, UI/UX, Security, Packaging and Distributions, etc.
*** Non-feature: “Infrastructure”, “Outreach programs”, “Governance”, etc.
** _Status_ - Status of the initiative#
** _URL_ - Link to a page which provides details about the project.

*** Project page on jenkins.io (e.g. a
https://jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2019/gitlab-support-for-multibranch-pipeline/[GSoC Project_])
*** Section on a jenkins.io page (e.g.
https://jenkins.io/sigs/docs#ongoing-projects[project description on a SIG page])
*** Link to a Jira issue or EPIC (e.g.
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/WEBSITE-637[WEBSITE-637])

* Roadmap is visualized on the Jenkins website, as
https://jenkins.io/project/roadmap[https://jenkins.io/project/roadmap].
** Blueocean Roadmap frontend codebase is reworked to support the Jenkins roadmap.
  Hard fork of the CSS/JS files will be used to be able to edit the roadmap quickly.
* Governance documents are updated to reference the Roadmap page and to reference this JEP and the communication channels.

==== Roadmap file sample

See https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/2957[jenkins.io/pull/2957].

==== Rendering sample

WARNING: MOCK DATA!

Topics to address:

* Vertical layout consumes too much space when it comes to the target number of items (around 40?).
  We could rework it to show Items in columns instead, it will allow to make it shorter.

=== Process

==== Ownership

Roadmap is managed by the https://jenkins.io/project/board/[Jenkins Governance Board] (in the future “Roadmap maintainers”).
In the future this role may be transferred to a Technical Steering Committee if/when it is created.
They review and approve the roadmap suggestions for publishing.
There is also a quarterly public roadmap review meeting organized by the maintainers.

Controversial cases can be escalated to the developer mailing list.
If consensus is not reached on the developer mailing list,
then controversial cases will be resolved at the https://jenkins.io/project/governance-meeting/[Jenkins Governance Meeting].

==== Eligibility

In order to be displayed on the roadmap, an initiative should match the following conditions:

* Major value to the Jenkins users or to the community
* Confirmed interest in the project by contributors.
  A number of contributors should declare their intent to work on the project.
* Significant scope of work and project duration.
  We expect major initiatives to take weeks/months to complete.
* Clear description available on the initiative page
* Clear communication channels available on the initiative page.
  Mailing list, Gitter, meeting links (if applicable).
* Nice to have: Contributing guidelines if there is any specifics in the project (required permissions, etc.)

==== Submitting roadmap suggestions

Any Jenkins contributor can submit a pull request with a suggestion for a Jenkins roadmap.
Suggestions will be reviewed by “Roadmap maintainers”, and they will get the SIGs, sub-projects and subject matter experts involved if needed.

* Each Jenkins project entity (e.g. SIG/sub-project/team) is eligible to add their roadmap entries.
  In such cases these entries should be discussed in the entity channels and signed off by entity leaders.
  _Roadmap maintainers_ still review the formal side of the request.
* Maintainers of other plugins and components are eligible to submit their roadmap proposals.
  Such pull requests will be reviewed by Roadmap Maintainers, see the _Eligibility_ section below.
* Any other Jenkins community member can submit a proposal.
  If there is no SIG/sub-project behind the proposal, it will likely require a discussion in Jenkins channels to verify eligibility and improve visibility of the proposal.

==== Maintaining roadmap entries

We expect the initiative submitters to track progress of the roadmap initiatives and to update the initiative statuses accordingly.
The “Roadmap maintainers” team will be doing periodic scrubs of the roadmap to discover and modify outdated entries,
but there is no guarantee of full consistency for the roadmap (“eventual consistency”).
Whomever discovers an issue, pull requests are welcome.

==== Roadmap review meeting

Once per quarter _Roadmap maintainers_ will organize a public roadmap review meeting.
It may be held as a part of the https://jenkins.io/project/governance-meeting/[Jenkins Governance Meeting] or as a separate meeting.
This meeting will be used to discuss the completed initiatives, verify the state of the roadmap and to identify the missing initiatives.

==== Preventing the roadmap from bloating

_Roadmap maintainers_ are responsible to keep the number of items in the roadmap within a comprehensible range.
Recommendation is to have a limited number of projects per category:

* “Current” - up to 3
* “Near Term” - up to 3
* “Future” - up to 5

== Rollout plan

Once the proposal is confirmed in principle, the following process will be applied:

* The proposal is implemented and submitted as a pull request
* A developer mailing list email is sent to facilitate contributions to the draft (initial data and initiatives)
* `Mar 25, 2020` - There is voting at the governance meeting which signs-off publishing of the roadmap draft
* The roadmap draft is published as a draft with explicit “Work in Progress” disclaimers in the Web UI
* All entities in Jenkins (SIGs, sub-projects, etc.) are contacted via mailing lists and invited to contribute to the roadmap draft
* `2 weeks later` - There is a blogpost with a roadmap draft announcement and invitation to contribute in public
* Roadmap draft is presented at the Jenkins online meetup for developers
* `2+ weeks later` - Governance meeting with voting for publishing the roadmap as an active version
* Work-in-progress disclaimers are removed, the roadmap is considered as official
* Announcements in social media and the Jenkins blog

After the rollout, the roadmap will be maintained by the _Roadmap maintainers_ team as documented above.

== Motivation

Jenkins is a community-driven project.
Changes there happen only in those areas where we have contributors. 
At the same time, now we have a lot of entities like special interest groups, sub-projects and teams.
These entities drive many key initiatives in the community in a coordinated way, and largely use their own channels for that.
One has to find these channels to follow a project.
A Jenkins user or an outside contributor might have difficulties understanding what is going on and how to contribute.

This proposal documents a new roadmap process which would make planned changes more explicit and which would highlight the potential projects to Jenkins contributors and users.
It will help Jenkins users and vendors to properly plan their work and to contribute to the projects they are interested in.

== Reasoning

=== Why don’t we just use the Blue Ocean roadmap structure?

Blue Ocean roadmap is a good example of visualization and the implementation.
Blue Ocean roadmap was removed from the main site after putting the project on hold, but there is a version on cn.jenkins.io.

* Site: https://jenkins.io/zh/projects/blueocean/roadmap/
* Source code:
** Data JSON: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/cn.jenkins.io/blob/master/content/projects/blueocean/roadmap/data.json[/content/projects/blueocean/roadmap/data.json]
** https://github.com/jenkins-infra/cn.jenkins.io/blob/master/content/projects/blueocean/roadmap/index.html.haml[HAML for the page]
** CSS and JavaScript Code linked from the pages above

Blue Ocean layout does not work for us as is.
Reasons:

* Vertical layout is too long. We would need to make rendering better
* “Released” and “Not Planned” sections consume a lot of space.
  We need to somehow highlight “released” so that users can see new features,
  but “Not planned” is an overkill
* One story may belong to multiple categories (e.g. “Read-only Configuration Web UI” is both UX and Configuration-as-Code).
  In BlueOcean format there is only one category supported for an entry.

== Backwards Compatibility

N/A

== Security

Security concerns are not applicable to this process JEP. 

Jenkins security will be one of the categories in the roadmap,
and it will include public stories like Security hardening or security-related features.
Planned security fixes will not be included into the roadmap unless the Jenkins Security officer decides otherwise.

== Infrastructure Requirements

This proposal does not require additional services to be deployed.


== Testing

Testing will be performed as a part of the experimental phase until the roadmap is fully published.
