Use this space to track the status of plugins that may or may not be compatible with JEP-0000.
Refer to general information about link:README.adoc#backwards-compatibility[backwards compatibility]
for tips on searching for potentially problematic API usages.

Please use pull requests as needed to help maintain the following table.
Plugins should be sorted by code identifier
(usually, but not always, the portion in the GitHub repository name preceding `-plugin`).

|Plugin |Status |Notes

|link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/active-directory/[active-directory]
|Incompatible, fixes prepared
|link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/active-directory-plugin/pull/102[active-directory-plugin #102]
is required to make the plugin work in both old and new cores.

|link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/artifactory/[artifactory]
|Incompatible, fixes prepared
|link:https://github.com/jfrog/jenkins-artifactory-plugin/pull/327[artifactory-plugin #327]
is necessary.

|link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/authorize-project/[authorize-project]
|Probably compatible, untested
|link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/authorize-project-plugin/pull/46[authorize-project-plugin #46]
was filed as cleanup to make testing against recent cores easier.

|https://plugins.jenkins.io/blueocean/[blueocean]
|Probably compatible
|link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/blueocean-plugin/pull/2084[blueocean-plugin #2084]
cleans up some related APIs and enables testing.

|https://plugins.jenkins.io/branch-api/[branch-api]
|Compatible
|link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/branch-api-plugin/pull/209[branch-api-plugin #209]
cleans up some API usages for testing.

|https://plugins.jenkins.io/cas-plugin/[cas-plugin]
|Incompatible
|Uses `BeanBuilder` and several removed Acegi Security types.

|https://plugins.jenkins.io/coding-webhook/[coding-webhook]
|Incompatible
|Uses `CliAuthenticator`.

|https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials/[credentials]
|Compatible
|link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/credentials-plugin/pull/164[credentials-plugin #164]
cleans up some related APIs.

|https://plugins.jenkins.io/crowd/[crowd]
|Incompatible
|Uses `BeanBuilder` and possibly other problematic types.

|https://plugins.jenkins.io/crowd2/[crowd2]
|Incompatible
|Uses some unsupported types from Acegi Security.

|link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-oauth/[github-oauth]
|Incompatible, fixes prepared
|link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-oauth-plugin/pull/119[github-oauth-plugin #119]
is necessary.
Given that, it seems to work.

|https://plugins.jenkins.io/jenkins-cloudfoundry-uaa/[jenkins-cloudfoundry-uaa]
|Incompatible
|Uses `BeanBuilder` and possibly other problematic types.

|link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/ldap/[ldap]
|Incompatible, fixes prepared
|link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/ldap-plugin/pull/46[ldap-plugin #46] &
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/ldap-plugin/pull/48[ldap-plugin #48]
are required to make the plugin work in both old and new cores.
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/ldap-plugin/pull/49[ldap-plugin #49] (a work in progress)
would make it natively use Spring Security.

|https://plugins.jenkins.io/restricted-register/[restricted-register]
|Probably compatible
|Refers to `HudsonPrivateSecurityRealm` but is probably safe.

|link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/reverse-proxy-auth-plugin/[reverse-proxy-auth-plugin]
|Incompatible
|link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/reverse-proxy-auth-plugin/pull/38[reverse-proxy-auth-plugin #38]
is merely cleanup to make it easier to even test against new cores.

The code base not only makes use of `BeanBuilder` and Acegi Security APIs for which no compatibility is offered,
but like the `ldap` plugin it makes use of the LDAP parts of Acegi Security which are heavily refactored in Spring Security.
Compatibility with this JEP is expected to be significant effort.

The plugin has not been released in 2Â½ years;
even then it was only released by Jenkins CERT members
to allow critical fixes for link:../200/README.adoc[JEP-200]
(link:https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/9mX-S7kLnHk/m/J6tlhM6vAQAJ[background]).
It appears to now be abandoned and in need of adoption.

|link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/saml/[saml]
|Probably compatible, untested
|link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/saml-plugin/pull/90[saml-plugin #90]
would take advantage of the Spring update.

|https://plugins.jenkins.io/sfee/[sfee]
|Incompatible
|Uses `CliAuthenticator` and some unsupported Acegi Security types.

|link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/splunk-devops/[splunk-devops]
|Incompatible, fixes prepared
|link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/splunk-devops-plugin/pull/13[splunk-devops-plugin #13]
is necessary.

|link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/suppress-stack-trace/[suppress-stack-trace]
|Obsolete
|After link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/suppress-stack-trace-plugin/pull/5[suppress-stack-trace-plugin #5]
this plugin is deprecated and should not be used.
Older versions may be incompatible.

|link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/throttle-concurrents/[throttle-concurrents]
|Incompatible, fixes prepared
|link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/throttle-concurrent-builds-plugin/pull/85[throttle-concurrent-builds-plugin #85]
is necessary.
