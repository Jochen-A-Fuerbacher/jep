Use this space to track the status of plugins that may or may not be compatible with JEP-0000.
Refer to general information about link:README.adoc#backwards-compatibility[backwards compatibility]
for tips on searching for potentially problematic API usages.

Plugins which do not do anything special with Acegi Security or Spring types need not be listed.
In particular, some very routine usages such as `ACL.as(ACL.SYSTEM)` are not cause for concern
since core retains binary compatibility for these.
All link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/extensions/jenkins-core/#securityrealm[plugins defining a `SecurityRealm`] should be listed.

Please use pull requests as needed to help maintain the following table.
Plugins should be sorted by code identifier
(usually, but not always, the portion in the GitHub repository name preceding `-plugin`).

|Refers to `HudsonPrivateSecurityRealm` but is probably safe.

|link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/reverse-proxy-auth-plugin/[reverse-proxy-auth-plugin]
|Incompatible
|The code base not only makes use of `BeanBuilder` and Acegi Security APIs for which no compatibility is offered,
but like the `ldap` plugin it makes use of the LDAP parts of Acegi Security which are heavily refactored in Spring Security.
Compatibility with this JEP is expected to be significant effort.

link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/reverse-proxy-auth-plugin/pull/38[reverse-proxy-auth-plugin #38]
is merely cleanup to make it easier to even test against new cores.

The plugin has not been released in 2Â½ years;
even then it was only released by Jenkins CERT members
to allow critical fixes for link:../200/README.adoc[JEP-200]
(link:https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/9mX-S7kLnHk/m/J6tlhM6vAQAJ[background]).
It appears to now be abandoned and in need of adoption.

|link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/saml/[saml]
|Probably compatible
|PCT passes, but not sanity tested.
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/saml-plugin/pull/90[saml-plugin #90]

|Obsolete
|After link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/suppress-stack-trace-plugin/pull/5[suppress-stack-trace-plugin #5]
in 1.6 this plugin is deprecated and should not be used.
Older versions may be incompatible.
